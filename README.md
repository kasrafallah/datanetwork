# data network

Data Networks is one of the master's courses that I took in the sixth semester of my undergraduate degree.
The exercises of this lesson, which were of 4 different layers, were in the languages of "C++", MATLAB, NS3 emulator, Netanya, Wire Shark, Python, etc., which can be seen in the above folders.

### topics:
- #### [physical layer](https://github.com/kasrafallah/datanetwork/tree/main/physical_layer)
- #### [data link layer](https://github.com/kasrafallah/datanetwork/tree/main/datalink_layer)
  ##### channel simulation and coding methods
  ##### implementing Bitstiffing coding with channel simulation
  ##### implemrnting 4B/5B coding with channel simulation
  ##### implementing hamming code coder and decoder
     ###### 1.soft decision
     ###### 2.hard decision
  ##### channel simulation bit one parity bit with BER analyis
  ##### channel simulation with  to 7 hamming code with BER analyis
  ##### channel simulation with  to 7 hamming code and parity bits with retrasmition methodwith BER analyis
